## Intro

The purpose of this repository is to create a searchable index of treaties made between Native nations and the US government. Over time, more treaties can be added to make the index even more valuable not just to Native peoples but those interested in studying Native law in the US.

The seed for this index comes from G. William Rice, a former professor at the University of Tulsa, who taught Indian Law and gaming. His website is still available and includes a decent number of treaties.

This repo will hold data about US and Canadian treaties with Indigenous nations. Right now, this consists of HTML files which should be parsed. Later, we'll archive the HTML files which allowed us to seed this data initially.
